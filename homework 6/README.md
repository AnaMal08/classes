The scatterplot illustrates numbers of earthquakes worldwide in the past 7 days. Large numbers of earthquakes in California are emphasized on the graph. The main objective of this graph is to compare intensity, amount, and average of earthquakes worldwide vs in California. In the last 7 days, 53% percentage of all earthquakes on our planet occurred in California. The high amount of seismic activity on the West coast is caused by the movement of the Pacific and North American plates. Although California has the most earthquakes versus the rest of the world, the magnitude of California’s earthquakes are not as dangerous compared to earthquakes worldwide. The highest magnitude of California’s earthquakes reaches 3.72 vs the magnitude of 6 worldwide and the average magnitude in California is 1.01, whereas, the average worldwide is 1.53.
