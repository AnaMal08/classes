1. Goals 
   <br>
   The purpose of this project is to create zoomable and interactive map of Washington D.C. that shows the location of bike stations,      bike trails, and interesting places in D.C.  I used the OpenStreetMap tiles as a basemap for a better orientation in a city.            Interactivity of the application allows us to hover over points to see an additional information and pictures.
