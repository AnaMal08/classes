#### Documentation

Add the following content to the README.md in your repo.   

1. Goals 
   <br>
   The purpose of this project is to create zoomable and interactive map of Washington D.C. that shows the location of bike stations,      bike trails, and interesting places in D.C.  I used the OpenStreetMap tiles as a basemap for a better orientation in a city.            Interactivity of the application allows us to hover over points to see an additional information and pictures.   
    * How will this improve upon the existing map tool at opendata.dc.gov?
2. Attribution
   * Data Sources 
      - Map Tiles - Open Street Maps
