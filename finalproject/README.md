#### Documentation

Add the following content to the README.md in your repo.
   1.The purpose of this project is to create zoomable and interactive map of Washington D.C. that shows the location of bike stations, bike trails, and interesting places in D.C.  I used the OpenStreetMap tiles as a basemap for a better orientation in a city. Interactivity of the application allows us to hover over points to see an additional information and pictures.
